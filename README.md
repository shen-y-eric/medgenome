# MedGenome Snake Genome Browser

I independently developed an interactive genome browser for visualizing and inspecting genomics data for non-model organisms at my 2021 summer internship at MedGenome. We are currently working to publicly host site on company's servers. This website will be included in a future research publication about how snake genomes can help develop antivenoms.
